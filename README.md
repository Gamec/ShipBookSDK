# ShipBook SDK for iOS

[![Swift Package Manager](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift%20Package%20Manager-compatible-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/ShipBook/ShipBookSDK-iOS)

Shipbook SDK for iOS applications. Capture logs, errors, and exceptions from your iOS apps and view them in the [Shipbook console](https://console.shipbook.io/). Learn more at [shipbook.io](https://www.shipbook.io/).

## Installation

Add the package URL in Xcode via Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/ShipBook/ShipBookSDK-iOS.git
```

## Quick Start

```swift
import ShipBookSDK

// Initialize Shipbook in AppDelegate (do this once at app startup)
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    ShipBook.start(appId: "YOUR_APP_ID", appKey: "YOUR_APP_KEY")
    return true
}

// Get a logger for your class/component
let log = ShipBook.getLogger("MyViewController")

// Log messages at different severity levels
log.v("Detailed trace information")
log.d("Debug information")
log.i("General information")
log.w("Warning message")
log.e("Error message")
```

## Features

- **Remote Logging** - View all your app logs in the Shipbook console
- **Error Tracking** - Automatically captures uncaught exceptions
- **Session Tracking** - Group logs by user session
- **Offline Support** - Logs are queued and sent when connectivity is restored
- **Dynamic Configuration** - Change log levels remotely without redeploying
- **User Identification** - Associate logs with specific users

## Configuration

### Enable Inner Logging (Debug Mode)

```swift
ShipBook.enableInnerLog(enable: true)
```

### Register User

```swift
ShipBook.registerUser(userId: "user-123",
                      userName: "johndoe",
                      fullName: "John Doe",
                      email: "john@example.com",
                      phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
                      additionalInfo: ["role": "admin"])
```

### Logout

```swift
ShipBook.logout()
```

### Screen Tracking

```swift
ShipBook.screen(name: "HomePage")
```

### Static Log Methods

You can also use static methods without creating a logger instance:

```swift
Log.e("Something went wrong")
Log.w("This is a warning")
Log.i("General info")
Log.d("Debug info")
Log.v("Trace info")
```

### Objective-C

The SDK is fully compatible with Objective-C. Convenience macros are provided:

```objective-c
#import <ShipBookSDK/ShipBookSDK-Swift.h>
#import <ShipBookSDK/ShipBook.h>

LogE(@"Something went wrong");
LogW(@"This is a warning");
LogI(@"General info");
LogD(@"Debug info");
LogV(@"Trace info");
```

## Getting Your App ID and Key

1. Sign up at [shipbook.io](https://www.shipbook.io/)
2. Create a new application in the console
3. Copy your App ID and App Key from the application settings
